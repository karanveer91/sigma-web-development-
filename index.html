    I'm a Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer with a solid background in backend development and modern web services. I focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and RESTful APIs while also building scalable web applications using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I know my way around database management and version control, and I’ve got experience with deploying applications from start to finish. On top of that, I’ve worked with blockchain basics, smart contracts, and Web3 integrations using JavaScript and Solidity.
